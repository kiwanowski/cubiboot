## Installation - [PicoLoader](https://github.com/makeo/PicoLoader)/[PicoBoot](https://github.com/webhdx/PicoBoot) with gekkoboot payload
1. Download the [```cubiboot.dol```](https://github.com/makeo/cubiboot/releases/latest/download/cubiboot.dol)
2. Rename it to ```ipl.dol```
3. Copy the ```ipl.dol``` onto your SD card

## Using In-Game Reset

2. Extract the contents to the root of the SD card
3. Pressing Z + A + START whilst in a game brings you back to the cubiboot menu

## Other ODEs (e.g. GC Loader)
Download the [```cubiboot.iso```](https://github.com/makeo/cubiboot/releases/latest/download/cubiboot.iso) and use it as appropriate for your ODE.\
Files and the config have to be stored on a separate SD2SP2, SD Gecko or similar SD adapter.\
ODEs besides PicoLoader are not supported, and issues specific to these devices might not be fixed.

## Known Bugs
- loading of files is slow when changing directories
- cube_logo option does not work
- button_* options to not work (use gekkoboot for this functionality instead)
- no PicoBoot uf2
