FUNCTION
	<<strncmp>>---character string compare
	
INDEX
	strncmp

SYNOPSIS
	#include <string.h>
	int strncmp(const char *<[a]>, const char * <[b]>, size_t <[length]>);

DESCRIPTION
	<<strncmp>> compares up to <[length]> characters
	from the string at <[a]> to the string at <[b]>.

RETURNS
	If <<*<[a]>>> sorts lexicographically after <<*<[b]>>>,
	<<strncmp>> returns a number greater than zero.  If the two
	strings are equivalent, <<strncmp>> returns zero.  If <<*<[a]>>>
	sorts lexicographically before <<*<[b]>>>, <<strncmp>> returns a
	number less than zero.

PORTABILITY
<<strncmp>> is ANSI C.

<<strncmp>> requires no supporting OS subroutines.
